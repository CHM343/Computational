# Computational Chemistry

Physical chemistry (pchem) lab has computational chemistry components for each of the laboratory exercises.  This repository is a place for the input and output data sets associated with computational chemistry calculations.  The most commonly used computational chemistry packages are [molecalc.cloud](https://molecalc.cloud/) ([GAMESS](https://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/gamess/)), [Gaussian 16](https://gaussian.com/), [ORCA 6](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/app.php/portal), and [Psi4](https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/index.html#).
